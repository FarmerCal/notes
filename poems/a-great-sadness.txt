A Great Sadness
poem by Cal Day Ham

A beautiful time
tears fall and I know what they mean
what do i mean?
I want to know, but I do
I am sad because things are so bbeautiful
this chair that holds me,
why the chair, why these thoughts, why do I care
why do I want to care?
I want to be something that I cannot understand
but I want to understand
wants at odds
a great pain
