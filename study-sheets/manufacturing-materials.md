# Cal's notes on manufacturing materials  

```
The purpose of this aggregated data is to guide the understanding of various manufacturing materials such that 
the utilization, discussion, and thought processes about these materials is as low in friction as possible.  

Specifically I will focus on:
	<> Names, both common and not so much  
	<> Structures, if helpful  
	<> Common use cases and techniques  
	<> How it is derrived, if applicable
	<> Information useful to understand that is not caught by the above buckets
