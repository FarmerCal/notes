## For I Know What I Must Do

I am in control<br>
For I know what I must do  

I will set high goals and exceed them  
I will not fall down to lower standards  
I will not fall down in the face of difficulty  
I will not fall down to my own shortcomings  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control

I am in control 

For I know what I must do


I will act to change

I will not participate in fluff

I will find things I love and bring them closer

I know the difference between love and lust


For I know what I must do

I am in control
