```
I am in control  
For I know what I must do  
```
```
I set *high goals* and *exceed* them  
I do not *fall* to lower *standards*  
I do not fall in the face of *difficulty*  
I do not fall to my own *shortcomings*  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control
```
```
I act to change  
I do not participate in *fluff*  
I *find* things I love and bring them *closer*  
I know the difference between love and *lust*  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control
```
```
I do not blame others for my own shortcomings  
I am a person who delivers  
I do things efficiently  
I *consider* the *problem* before acting  

For I know what I must do
I am in control
```
```
I *preserve* my *experiences* as they are all I am  
I preserve my body as it is my current *vessle*  
I preserve and grow my mind as it is my current *processor*  
I preserve and grow my *connections* as I am not alone

For I know what I must do  
I am in control

this is fluff

*closer* ->
