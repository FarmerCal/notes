For I Know What I Must Do
====  
by Cal Day Ham

----

I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I set high goals and exceed them  
I do not fall to lower standards  
I do not fall in the face of difficulty  
I do not fall to my own shortcomings  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control  

----

I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I act to change  
I do not participate in *fluff*  
I will find things I love and bring them closer  
I know the difference between love and lust  

For I know what I must do  
I am in control  

----

I am in control  
For I know what I must do  

I am a person who delivers  
I will not
