## Yo Tionne!

### Just wanted to say real quick that of the three salesmen we talked with today you were the most enjoyable to be around, good shit! 


<u>Ok so here’s a bit of a summary of what I was talking about in the car (keep in mind that I don’t have kids, although I was one not too long ago, and that there will always be unforeseen challenges). Also, when learning new things, especially with my generation and your kids generation, getting over the “this is way too hard and not worth the effort” hump is very difficult. I personally was stuck on the leading slope of that hill for about two years, knowing that coding would be an invaluable skill but being crushed by complexity and high learning curves, or so I thought. The key is to find rewards, preferably the rewards come from the coding and technical work itself, the feeling of seeing your name popup on a webpage after you type in “https://tionneskid.com” may be enough to get them to put in the next few hours of work for the next reward (and the rewards only get better as their skills increase!) That said, getting there is hard, you may need to step in and provide external rewards, don’t go crazy because they may come to expect it, and definitely don’t force it, this pushes most people away from coding. Coding is such a lovely thing, let them find that, and if they don’t, no problem! There are many other lovely things in life too!</u>


### Number 1:

Get your kids a computer, and preferably a good one. I have so many computers, all for different purposes, and most are not entry-level in cost or complexity. Later in life as your kids possibly learn to love computers they may build their own, this is a great exercise and yields often the best bang-for-your-buck because you get to design your own based on what you need, but the minimum is usually like a thousand and it is not super suitable for new people. Most of my computers are self-built, but I have a mac-air and a dell precision 7550. Both can do everything that your kids will want to do while they start learning but both are expensive, I would suggest getting a secondhand thinkpad X series, these beasts were built to just work, and they work. Here is the link to an example of what I’m talking about: https://www.ebay.com/itm/324348249751

### Number 2: 

Get them an operating system, preferably linux. Linux is open-source which means it can be a little less consumer friendly but is way more secure against viruses and is much more fun, also is much more customizable and better for learning. You will likely have to learn a little of the technical jargon yourself as you help them get set up though, like what a distro is. Here is an article I found talking about good distros for kids learning: https://www.makeuseof.com/best-educative-linux-distros-for-children-teachers-schools/ 
(once your kids are extremely epic get them to switch to the arch distro, if they haven’t by then anyway ?)

### Number 3:

Get them set up with an IDE (integrated development environment) which is just a place to write code and run it and do some other cool stuff, the best is VIM but it is kinda hard, I would say start them out with VS Code, it is one of the best GUI-based IDE’s https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux 

### Number 4: 

Pick a programming language to start them on. This honestly does not matter too much, the base-level concepts and thinking methodologies in coding extend through all languages. I would say choose something like python or javascript. Very common languages so there is TONS of epic information and tutorials online. 

### Number 5: 

Accounts they will need: AWS account or other cloud/web services thing, AWS has lots of free tiers so it’s great to learn from https://aws.amazon.com/free/ 
Github account, easy place to store your code that integrate will with git. https://github.com/signup 
Google drive if they don’t already, and of course their own email, just use gmail for now, in the future they can set up their own email servers and stuff!

### Number 6: 

Skills they will need: 
- git (version control)
- some language (python on javascript probably, maybe rust)
- command line, get comfortable with it, it is powerful.
- touch typing, 100 wpm is not too hard to reach and makes working on the computer very nice, I use https://monkeytype.com to practice.
- grit, never fucking give up, life is too short for that shit (but transferring your efforts to something that makes you more happy is fine)

### Number 7: 

how to learn: 
PROJECTS!!!! DO PROJECTS, not practicing random skills. Have an idea, like “I want a simple website I can go to” or “I want to write a simple phone app” then look up a simple tutorial and if you get stuck just google that shit. If you really can’t figure it out don’t stress, this shit is hard, get some food, some sleep, at least you’re working at it, then get back to it! 

# Final things: For you specifically Tionne, start your roth IRA, and max that sucker out each year! It won’t change your life right now but it may be the difference between a rental property when you retire and not having one! Also think big dude, one fucking life, love those around you and always be optimistic, pessimism is for people who don’t get shit done and want to drag you down. Always be learning, and remember, the only difference between you and ANYONE on earth is a few years of good decisions, keep learning. 

```Stay epic, Cal```
