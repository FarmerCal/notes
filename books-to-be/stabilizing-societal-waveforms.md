# Stabilizing Societal Waveforms

The current (circa 2020) fusion enegry problem has a sub-problem of containing undulating plasma. 
Just like any other material these undulations, or waveforms, can sum and over time lead to the evental breakout or breakdown of the containing system.
The solution is to make sure these undulations don't add, but often once the most obvious waveform is countered, a less obvious waveform, one acting 
on a longer time frame, becomes apparent. There can be many, many, of these waveforms acting on the plasma, so how do we control them all?

To step away from that example, societies can also have these differing levels of destabilizing waveforms.
