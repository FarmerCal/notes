Topics I am passionate about and would like to write about if the right time comes

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cancerous assention, escape, genesis, and growth of agential heigherarchies for the unfathomable fronteir

radical volitility and opposite body equilibrium governance

the instant death framework and building a timeless ego

radical solution genesis and distilation

scope maximizing, noticing over-scoping, and 

the string of you, building a real self 


reprogramming for getting your cake and eating it too, or icarus metaphor, you can get the best and not pay any consequences






------------------


air gap trade protocol
	- simple (the security does not arrise from chaos or complexity)
	- provably secure (simplicity such that each step can be logically summed to deduce a secure process)
	- clear bounds (scenarios where the system would break)
	
	
Secure drop (if there were cameras pointing right at you during the drop, and they new exactly when it happened, could they deduce it's you?)
Secure pickup (retreival of the item to be given in return, often money, must be easy and secure, untracable)
Secure communication (how do you tell the end-party where to pick up and what to do?) 

No trust needed (for the airgapped party, the end-user or distributor must employ trust)
