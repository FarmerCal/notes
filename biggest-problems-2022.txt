# What are my biggest problems in 2022 and what are possible solutions?

<> waste time on non-educational youtube videos that teach me very little, will often do this while eating or taking a break from work
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
	

<> eating too much, I definitely don't over eat but one of my main goals is extreem longevity in my current body, I must find a way to have my stable state be one of slight under-eating but with high nutrition
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
	

<> afraid or hesitant (not really sure) to push through on some things with respect to my work
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
	

<> not actually making any money
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
	

<> I posture a lot (or I atleast feel I do) and need to show with results more than I say I get results
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
	
<> Priortizing what I feel are less important time/energy spends because I enjoy them more in the short term
	SOLUTION BRAINSTORM
