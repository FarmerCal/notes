# Steps for basic web literacy

```
this doc was written for nikola, my good friend who is like a brother to me, but can be used by anyone.
keep in mind these suggestions are highly opinionated and not neccessarily the best choice for everyone.
that said, doing something is better that stagnation, in my opinion haha.

### Step 1  
get a computer that works
<> try not to get a mac but fine if you do
<> if you want a good brand before you build your own PC, thinkpads are good

### Step 2  
begin to teach yourself how to touch type if you can't already, this makes everything more enjoyable
<> practice site I use: https://monkeytype.com/
<> good symbols practice: https://thepracticetest.com/typing/practice/symbol-sentences/

### Step 3  
download an integrated development environment (IDE), if you want the simple anwser: vscode 
	<> download vscode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
	
### Step 4  
download git if you havent already and begin to familiarize yourself with the basic commands  
	<> git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
	<> basic git tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos
	<> longer git tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk
	
### Step 5   
set up the required web service accounts and such, in the future you may build some of these things yourself but for now it is better to use something already build to learn
	<> AWS account for cloud compute services and hosting and such: https://aws.amazon.com
	<> Github account for hosting code and projects and such: https://github.com
	<> make sure you keep these tabs accessible like with bookmarks and such, and play around in them, just be carefull about aws because they have your credit card haha

### Step 6
begin fucking around
	<> the best way to learn is to just do it
	<> don't try to understand everything in every tutorial, there are many ways to do most things so give yourself time to get the feel for everything, some people like to take notes, I take a few if something really seems good to remember but the most important part is applying the code
	<> subscribe to good youtube channels and start watching cool videos and following along with tutorials, check stack overflow or google if you have questions, know that with enough time, you could figure anything out

		<> javascript mastery: https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery
		<> web dev simplified: https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified
		<> fireship: https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship
		<> bugswriter (for inspiration, not tutorials): https://www.youtube.com/@bugswriter_
		<> 402 payment required: https://www.youtube.com/@402PaymentRequired
		<> be a better dev (for all things aws): https://www.youtube.com/@BeABetterDev
		<> luke smith, for the linux memes: https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz
		<> for react: https://www.youtube.com/@react.school3528

### Step 7  
keep fucking around, some specific projects
	<> build a personal website and host it
	<> build a calculator app
	<> build a mern stack app (google it lol)
