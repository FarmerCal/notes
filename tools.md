Feel free to fork this list for your own life, and help me build this tool!

Neoessentialists rely on first principles to set and achieve goals. The ultimate goal is one of understanding, because to understand is to be free.

### Preface
A tool, in the context of this document and in most references by myself, is a physical thing that facilitates 
the execution of a task. Hopefully that task is essential, but often it is not. A skill is a non-physical thing 
that facilitates the execution of a task, often utilizing many tools. I will, at some point, publish a similar
document outlining the Skills I enjoy for a Neoessentialists life.  

There are two main directives for this document, the first is for myself and the second for those reading.
First, it would help me in my current consolidation and reflection phase to catalog my tools, both by 
facilitating a filtering effect, and by orgaizing my thoughts in places other than my mind. Second, it 
my help some people to find a foothold in life and advancement. I know I love it when someone I know has
thought a long time about something, posts a list of their thoughts and tools on the subject. It's no substitute
for self-discovery, but not all things need to be done that way, and shouldn't.
