Bedrock foundation for continued conciousness.
Neoessentialists rely on first principles to set and achieve goals. 
The ultimate goal is one of understanding, because to understand is to be free.

## Overview  
What is your purpose? I have no fucking clue. 
That said, I'm fairly certain that the first step is increasing your understanding. Doing 
so will allow you to set higher goals, reach them faster, and compound at a much faster rate. 
If there is a purpose I am relativly confident 
it does not reside in mediocraty or satisfaction in ones progress. Many people have come and gone, many 
will likely do the same, but this is your shot. Put asside lack of free will as commonly accepted and 
sit for a moment in the wonder of conciousness. If trillions of grains of sand were falling from the sky 
and, using that energy, developed systems that were as amazingly complex as our own, that would be 
spectacular. Your conciousness is spectacular.  

So what is Neoessentialism and why am I trying to put a name to something that at it's heart is not much 
more than a jumping point, a bedrock to build on?

Why is it called "Neoessentialism"? Neo means new, some people have rose colored glasses for anything "new" 
and some people have the opposite. New in this sense is simply meant to display that this bedrock, this
framework that can be forked and merged and adapted, can do just that. The biggest mistake anyone can make
is believeing they know everything, besides inaction of course, but they are often synonymous. Essentialism
because it is one of the greatest inhibitors to have too much bloat. Choices are great if you can organize 
and categorize them, but our current proccessors are not built to make good decisions when presented with 
and overload of data. The essentials, the things that allow you to do what you need to and keep moving, are
what you should build your life on. Additionally, showing that something is essential is a very first-principles
type task, one that has many forward pointing benefits. There you go, Neoessentialism.
