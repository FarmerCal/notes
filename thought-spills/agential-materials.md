# Agential Materials and 

I was listening to a podcast today between Michael Levin and Lex Fridman and Michael brought up the idea of agential materials.

An agential material is different from our standard materials like wood, metal, stone, etc, because it has its own agency in addition to interacting with the rules of the world.
Under a microscope, this agency is just a far more complex and near-irretracable interaction with the rules of the world, but that is ok.

Agential materials reminded me of employees, or even departments in a company.
The employee has its own agency but it can be "formed" and trained to help in the completion of a higher goal, same with departments of employees.

very interesting.

This could point to the "self" simply being the ability to set and complete those higher goals, as this is really the only common denominator I currently see.
