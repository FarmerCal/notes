Sometimes I find myself bubbling with confidence. These scenarios often happen when I am in an evironment that I am already extreemly confident 
and importantly, happy in. In these scenarios, talking to people and coming away with a positive feeling about what just happened is very common. Even women that I am interested in,
often the demographic of people that most obstruct my ability to be confident in myself, seem to fall into conversation with me far easier.

I think this is due to my ambient comfort level, and also my feeling of safety. Safety in that if something negative happens in the convo, everything 
else is fine because I have many other people and things who still respect me.

Building this confidence in places where I have not become supremely comfortable and happy (most of the world) has proven to be difficult.
For that reason I am going to try and assemble a number of ice-breaker conversation starters. To give me the best chance at making the connection I am 
looking for, and to give the women in question as much comfort as well.



Hi, I have a really quick question.
ok, my name is cal (go for handshake) and the question is
can you think of an acceptable reason for me to be atempting to start a conversation with you? ;)
