# The Essentials  
Life lessons for the growth-minded  
====  


The goal is														> to procure your desired results 
You have the gifted and unexplainable ability to 				> derive a list of meaningful and self-unique desired results that grow in meaningful and self-unique ways (kinda saying you have unexplainable free will)
Local maximum is very dangerous 								> assess your situation
Everything is your fault 										> that way you can change it
It is easy to quit something you know is bad for you			> not difficult
You must measure the things you want to manage 					> or you will not know your growth
Your desired results are just that, yours 						> don't naturally expect others to guide you towards them
To recieve value from agential peers you must 					> either provide value or convince that you are providing value, one is much easier and scalable long term than the other
Be optimistic, not pessimistic 									> optimism is the act of believing your current actions towards obtaining desired results will not be rendered entirely useless by unknown future events, pessimism is the opposite and for loosers
Don't be hopeful												> hope is the act of believing that unknown future events will be unexpectedly useful to your procuration of desired results, this is hurtful in a similar way to pessimism, where it hinders current prolificity and does not incentivise action and growth.
Be interested in things											> immediate criticism and drawing of opinions can be a very limiting habbit
Happiness and sadness are relative								> you cannot have one without the other, but the total average can move based on your growth (rate of procuring desired results)
Discounting experiences can be limiting							> similar to item 10, do your own research and make sure you will not be fundamentally broken by an experience 
There is no reason to kill yourself								> Ending is not an option, feel free to pause though but understand there will be reprocussions, good or bad (do something completely tangential)
